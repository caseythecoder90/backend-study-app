Feature: Multi-Model AI Provider Configuration
  As a developer
  I want to configure multiple AI providers
  So that users can choose their preferred AI model

  Background:
    Given the AI service is configured with multiple providers
    And the following models are available:
      | provider   | model            |
      | OPENAI     | GPT_4O_MINI     |
      | ANTHROPIC  | CLAUDE_SONNET_4 |
      | GOOGLE     | GEMINI_1_5_FLASH |

  Scenario: Generate flashcards with OpenAI model
    Given I am authenticated as "testuser"
    When I request flashcard generation with:
      | text  | Photosynthesis converts light to chemical energy |
      | model | GPT_4O_MINI                                      |
      | count | 3                                                |
    Then the request should succeed
    And 3 flashcards should be generated
    And the AI provider used should be "OPENAI"

  Scenario: Generate flashcards with Anthropic model
    Given I am authenticated as "testuser"
    When I request flashcard generation with:
      | text  | Machine learning algorithms learn from data |
      | model | CLAUDE_SONNET_4                            |
    | count | 5                                          |
    Then the request should succeed
    And 5 flashcards should be generated
    And the AI provider used should be "ANTHROPIC"

  Scenario: Fallback to secondary model when primary fails
    Given the model "GPT_4O" is unavailable
    And fallback is enabled with models "GPT_4O_MINI,CLAUDE_3_5_HAIKU"
    When I request flashcard generation with:
      | text  | Database normalization reduces redundancy |
      | model | GPT_4O                                    |
      | count | 2                                        |
    Then the request should succeed with fallback
    And the fallback model "GPT_4O_MINI" should be used
    And 2 flashcards should be generated

  Scenario: All models fail with appropriate error
    Given all AI models are unavailable
    When I request flashcard generation with:
      | text  | Test content |
      | model | GPT_4O_MINI  |
      | count | 1           |
    Then the request should fail with error "SERVICE_AI_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE"
    And the error message should contain "All AI models (primary and fallbacks) are unavailable"

  Scenario: Model text validation
    Given I am authenticated as "testuser"
    When I request flashcard generation with:
      | text  | <10001 character text> |
      | model | GPT_4O_MINI           |
      | count | 5                     |
    Then the request should fail with error "SERVICE_AI_INVALID_CONTENT"
    And the error message should contain "Text length exceeds maximum"
```
